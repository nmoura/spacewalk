# sync.conf
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is the configuration file for the *sync.py scripts. Below, some
# descriptions of important variables in the sections.
#
# To this script work properly, you should have one registration at RHN for
# each of the base Red Hat version. For instance, one for RHEL 5 Server and
# another for the RHEL 6 Server. When you do the registration, a systemid
# file are generated, and you should put this file inside a specific
# hierarchy directory, explained below with the base_dir variable
# explanation.
#
# [default]:
#   base_dir
#    A directory with enough space to the packages downloaded from Red Hat
#    Network. This directory should contain just one subdirectory for each
#    Red Hat version, like 5Server and 6Server, and each of this subdirectory
#    will have one directory for each child channel.
#
#    Example of a tree in the filesystem:

#      │   ├── system.id
#      │   ├── rhel-x86_64-client-5

#
#   proxy       - URL to the proxy server.
#   mail_to     - An email address to send a report if some error occurs.
#   mail_server - The email server URL.
#
# [spacewalk]:
#   spacewalk_url - The RPC Spacewalk Server URL.
#   Example: http://spacewalk.domain.com/rpc/api
#
# [rhn]:
#   rhn_url - The XMLRPC URL of Red Hat Network.
#
# [rhn-channels]:
#   Each entry of this section is a convention from RHN that are related to
#   the base channel name, followed by the equal sign, and followed by the
#   child Red Hat channels of his base channel. An important note is that you
#   need to specify the base channel label too. Put all the label channels
#   from RHN that you want to synchronize.
# 
#   Example:
#     6Server = rhel-x86_64-server-6 rhn-tools-rhel-x86_64-server-6
#
#   At this time, the names at RHN since from release 5 are:
#     5Client, 5Server, 6Server and 6Workstation
#
# [rhn-translation]:
#   A 'from = to' list, with the label from the RHN in the left side of the
#   equal sign, and the related channel in the Spacewalk Server at the another
#   side. Useful for the rhn-tools* channels that can't be created in the
#   Spacewalk Server because the name begin with 'rhn'.
#
#   Example:
#     rhn-tools-rhel-x86_64-server-6 = rhel-rhn-tools-rhel-x86_64-server-6
#
# [merge-channels]:
#   Another 'from = to' list, but this is used for the repository
#   synchronization. Useful when you have equal channels like EPEL for CentOS
#   6 and RHEL 6, to don't download the same packages more than one time.
#
#   Example:
#     dag-centos-x86_64-5 = dag-rhel-x86_64-client-5 dag-rhel-x86_64-server-5
#
